# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-coursework

## About
This repository contains my code for coursework of the course [ECE421]([http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/180/](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ece421h1)): Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2023).

## Academic Integrity
To future students considering the use of this code, I urge you to treat it as a reference rather than a solution to your assignments. Plagiarism undermines the learning process and personal growth that assignments are designed to foster. Furthermore, it's important to note that course structures and requirements can evolve over time. I cannot anticipate changes that might be introduced in the future, which could render my code incompatible with the assignment's current specifications. The owner of this repository is **NOT** responsible for any academic offenses.
